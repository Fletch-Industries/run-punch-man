                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  My name is Run Punch Man and I run a 5k every day with my dog Juniper. I also do 100 situps, 
                  pushups, and squats every single day. Every day I post my R.E.D. to inspire myself and others 
                  to keep at their good habits - and never take a day off.

                  What started as a simple commitment to daily discipline has evolved into something much bigger. 
                  It's about showing up consistently, acknowledging the excuses that try to derail us, and finding 
                  something unique to celebrate about each day's effort.

                  R.E.D. stands for Reason, Excuse, and Difference. It's my daily accountability system. 
                  I share my reason for showing up, acknowledge the excuse I overcame, and highlight what 
                  made that day's effort special. It's about radical honesty and consistent action.

                  Every 5K is better with my faithful companion. Juniper doesn't make excuses, doesn't 
                  complain about the weather, and always shows up ready to run. She's taught me that 
                  consistency is simple when you stop overthinking it.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                "Never take a day off" isn't about perfection - it's about showing up. Some days my 5K 
                is fast and feels amazing. Other days it's slow and every step is a battle. But the 
                commitment remains the same: show up, do the work, and share the truth about what it took.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                This philosophy extends beyond fitness. It's about building character through daily 
                disciplines, being honest about our struggles, and inspiring others through authentic 
                vulnerability rather than highlight reels.

              <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                My mission is to inspire others to commit to their own version of "never miss a day." 
                Whether it's running, writing, praying, or any positive habit - the power is in the consistency. 
                Follow along for daily R.E.D. posts and see what happens when you stop making excuses and 
                start making progress.
